State Estimation
******************

In this section, we discuss the functionality that is required for state estimation in Tudat. Before starting this section, make sure to go through our page on :ref:`state_propagation_intro`, since the state *estimation* function requires the full functionality from state *propagation*. At the moment, the estimation functitonality of Tudat is limited to the use of batch least-squares. A broad range of parameters (initial translational and rotational state; single-, multi- and hybrid-arc states; numerous physical properties of the environment) from a diverse set of available observations is supported.

Estimation Inputs
=================

In addition to the inputs required for state propagation, the following needs to be set up to perform an estimation.

- **Parameter setup**: definition of the parameters that are to be estimated, as discussed :ref:`here <parameter_settings>` in the context of variational equation propagation
- **Link end setup**: define the stations/spacecraft involved in an observation, and define their role for a particular observable (receiver, transmitter, *etc.*), described :ref:`here <linkEndSetup>`
- **Observation model setup**: define the type and properties of a given (idealized) observation model, such as range, Doppler, *etc.*, :ref:`here <observationModelSetup>`
- **Simulating observations** OR **Loading observations**: depending on whether you are considering estimation in a simulated environment (in which case you simulate the observables in TudatPy, described :ref:`here <observationSimulation>`) or using real data (in which case you load them from files), you must create/load observations, and define properties such as times, noise, *etc.*.
- **Estimation settings**: define the *a priori* knowledge, convergence criteria, *etc.*, described :ref:`here <estimationSettings>`

Simulation/Analysis & Output
============================

Once all the settings are in place, the solution can be generated: the (simulated) observations can be fit to the dynamical model that has been defined to perform the fitting. Alternatively, the same functionality can be used for a covariance analysis only, in which case no fit is attempted. Details are provided on :ref:`this page <perform_estimation>`
