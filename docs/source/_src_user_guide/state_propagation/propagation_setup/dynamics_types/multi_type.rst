===================
Multi-type dynamics
===================

Tudat permits the propagation of any combination of types of dynamics, for any number of bodies
One example is the simulation of coupled translational-rotational dynamics of one or more bodies, or the combined translational and mass dynamics of a body (e.g. spacecraft under thrust).

To define multi-type propagator settings, you must first define the propagator settings for each type of dynamics separately, after which you combine these using the function as follows: 

    .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Python

          .. toggle-header:: 
             :header: Required **Show/Hide**

             .. literalinclude:: /_src_snippets/simulation/environment_setup/full_translational_setup.py
             .. literalinclude:: /_src_snippets/simulation/environment_setup/full_rotational_setup.py
             .. literalinclude:: /_src_snippets/simulation/environment_setup/full_mass_setup.py
                :language: python

          .. literalinclude:: /_src_snippets/simulation/environment_setup/full_multitype_setup.py
             :language: python

         .. tab:: C++

          .. literalinclude:: /_src_snippets/simulation/environment_setup/req_create_bodies.cpp
             :language: cpp

This example shows the use of the translational, rotational and mass dynamics of a single body ``Vehicle``. However, the framework is not limited to propagating the different types of dynamics for only one body. You may for instance propagate the translational state and mass of a spacecraft concurrently with the rotational state of the Earth. Also, you may propagate any number of any type of dynamics of any body, e.g. translational dynamics of 6 bodies, rotational dynamics of 4 bodies and mass of 2 bodies, where these three sets of bodies may but need not fully or partially overlap).
   
 .. Warning:: 

    When using multi-type propagator settings, the output variables, termination settings, and print interval defined through the ``propagation_setup.propagator.multi_type`` function are used. Settings of the same kind are also stored in the constituent single-type propagator settings, but these are fully ignored when using multi-type settings 

 .. note::
    
    When different state types are propagated, the state output contains the states in following order:

    - Translational state ( **T** )
    - Rotational state ( **R** )
    - Body mass state ( **M** )
    - Custom state ( **C** )

    When multiple bodies are propagated, the state output will contain the translational state of all bodies, followed by the rotational state of all bodies, and so on.
    Propagating all possible state types for two bodies will result in a state output of the following form:
    [ **T** Body 1, **T** Body 2, **R** Body 1, **R** Body 2, **M** Body 1, **M** Body 2, **C** Body 1, **C** Body 2 ]
