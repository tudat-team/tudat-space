Settings to propagate the rotational state of a body numerically can be created through the :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.rotational` factory function, described in detail in the `API documentation <https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/>`_. In the current page, only the Tudat-specific aspects of the input will be briefly described.
The default (conventional) representation for solving the rotational equations of motion is by using a vector of 7 elements:

  * The quaternion elements (vector :math:`\mathbf{q}` of size 4) of the rotation from body-fixed to inertial frame (see :ref:`quaternion_definition`)
  * The angular velocity (vector :math:`\boldsymbol{\omega}` of size 3) of the body w.r.t. the inertial frame, expressed in the body-fixed frame.

Several other formulations can be used if wanted (see below and :ref:`conventional_propagated_states`).



Inputs
=======

In addition to the settings described :ref:`here <propagation_inputs>`, the definition of rotational dynamics settings requires:

- A set of torque models (see :ref:`torque_model_setup`);
- The initial conditions for the propagation (rotational state as :math:`[\mathbf{q};\boldsymbol{\omega}]` and time)
- A propagator type, since the rotational state can have different representations (listed in :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.RotationalPropagatorType`; default is quaternions and angular velocity).

.. warning::

    The initial state must be provided as conventional state formulation :math:`[\mathbf{q};\boldsymbol{\omega}]`, **regardless of the propagator type**

.. _example:

Example
========

In the example below, the body "Spacecraft" will be propagated w.r.t. body "Earth", using given
torque models. A given initial state which defines the orientation of "Spacecraft" w.r.t. the
inertial reference frame is defined. A Runge Kutta 4 integrator is defined with step-size of 2
seconds. The propagation will terminate once the ``simulation_end_epoch`` termination condition is
reached. A rotational propagator that uses quaternions is defined. Next to that, the propagator is
asked to save the total torque norm as dependent variable. The time and rotational state will be
printed on the terminal once every 24 hours (simulation time).
