=======================================
Formulation of state coordinates
=======================================

In Tudat, the translational and rotational states (and the way they are propagated numerically) can have different
formulations. For instance, the most
common and obvious choice for the formulation of the translational state is cartesian coordinates, but there are
alternative options offered by the Tudat API. The user can supply their choice of formulation for translational and
rotational motion to the  :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.translational` and
:func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.rotational` functions respectively.
Below, a list of available options is provided.

.. note::
  The choice of formulation for state coordinates is often referred to as *propagator type*.

.. _translational_propagator_types:

Translational propagator types
==============================

The available propagator types for translational dynamics are:

- Cowell
- Encke
- Gauss-Kepleria
- Gauss Modified Equinoctial
- Unified State Model (USM)
- Unified State Model (USM) with Rodrigues parameters
- Unified State Model (USM) with exponential map

.. seealso::
  The list of available translational propagator type and a brief description with references to literature are
  available in the API reference (see :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.TranslationalPropagatorType`).

.. _rotational_propagator_types:

Rotational propagator types
==============================

The available propagator types for rotational dynamics are:

- Quaternions
- Rodrigues parameters
- Exponential map

  The list of available rotational propagator type and a brief description with references to literature are
  available in the API reference (see :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.RotationalPropagatorType`).

Conventional vs. Propagated Coordinates
=======================================

In the description of some of the objects in this part of the wiki about the simulation setup, you may have noticed the
use of two names to describe the propagated states of an object. These two names are:

- *conventional* state;
- *propagated* state.

They describe two different manners to describe the state and are used in different parts of
the code. What was described above in the page (in :ref:`translational_propagator_types` and
:ref:`rotational_propagator_types`) refers only to the *propagated* state.
In this part of the wiki, you will get to know in what ways they differ and how that may affect your
application.

.. note::
  The two terms are only used for the states that are being numerically propagated (so not for those taken from an
  ephemeris, for instance).

Taking translational dynamics as an example, the short distinction between the two concepts is that the conventional
formulation is the state in Cartesian elements, while  the propagated formulation is the state that is actually
being propagated numerically (see :ref:`translational_propagator_types`).
For instance, when using the formulation of the equations of motion in Keplerian elements,
the propagated state is the current state, as defined in Keplerian elements, and the conventional state is its
conversion to Cartesian elements.

Conventional Coordinates
--------------------------

These coordinates are mainly used to describe the state of the object(s) in any place *other* than the state vector
that is being fed to the numerical integrator.

For the supported dynamics types, the following formulations are defined to be the conventional formulation:

- **Translational Motion**: Cartesian coordinates
- **Rotational Motion**: Quaternions defining rotation to body-fixed frame, angular velocity vector in body-fixed frame (see :ref:`rotational_dynamics`)
- **Mass Dynamics**: Current mass (no other formulation is used)

You will find and need to use *conventional* coordinates in these scenarios:

- o describe the initial conditions of an object when creating propagator settings (typically using the :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.translational` or :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.rotational` functions)
- As an output to the ``state_history`` function from a ``Simulator`` object (such as the :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.SingleArcSimulator` class)
- When extracting the current state from a :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.Body` object

Internally, Tudat uses the *conventional* state in the following places:

- to update the environment model of an object (this also means that the states extracted from the body are expressed
  in the conventional coordinates);
- to update the acceleration model of an object.


Propagated Coordinates
-------------------------

The *propagated* coordinates, on the other hand, are used to describe the state in the actual differential equations
being used. Thus, you will find these elements here:

- As an output to the ``unprocessed_state_history`` function of a ``Simulator`` object (such as the :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.SingleArcSimulator` class)

Internally, Tudat uses the *propagated* state in the following place:

- As the input/output of the numerical integrator's state derivative funcion

As a user, you will generally only interact with the conventional coordinates, but you will have the choice over which
propagated coordinate to use for propagation/integration. Even though you may rarely interact with the propagated
coordinates, a judicious choice of formulation of equations of motion (*e.g.*, definition of propagated coordinates)
can have a significant influence on the quality of your numerical results.



.. note::

    Since the conventional coordinates are used to update the environment and accelerations of the bodies, but the
    propagated coordinates are the ones used in propagation, you can see that whenever the conventional and propagated
    coordinates differ, there is a need to convert between the two at every time step (or even multiple times, if the time
    step is divided in multiple steps for integration). Therefore, this leads to a set of extra operations to be perfomed
    during propagation, which may in turn lead to a longer computation time for a single evaluatuon of the state derivative
    and/or increased numerical error. However, these aspects are rarely influential.

.. note::
    Another fact to consider, is that sometimes there may be a difference between the size of the conventional and
    propagates states. For instance, a Cartesian state is expressed with 6 elements, but the USM7 state with 7. This may
    lead to some confusion when extracting the results, so keep this in mind. In the next section, you can find the size of
    each propagated type used in Tudat.
