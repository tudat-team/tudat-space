Propagation Examples
====================

Introductory examples
*********************

The following examples showcase the basic functionality of the Tudat numerical propagation framework, for both dynamics and the associated variational equations.

Advanced examples
*********************

The following examples, some of the more advanced features of Tudat are showcased, using either custom functions for guidance, or a more complex defintition of the equations of motion.
Note that an additional related example (in particular on the setup of a custom environment) can be found on the page for :ref:`asteroid_optimization_examples`
