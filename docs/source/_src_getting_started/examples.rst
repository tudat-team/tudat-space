Examples
************************

There are several example applications available in `this repository`_, in the form of Python scripts.
At the top of each `.py` example file, the topic and goals of such example application are explained in detail.

In addition, to facilitate the understanding of tudat(py) code, a selection of the example applications are
illustrated in more detail in the pages linked below.

Examples with PyGMO
===================

Below you can find general examples, explained in detail, about optimizing an astrodynamical problem simulated in
TudatPy through `Pygmo <https://esa.github.io/pygmo2/index.html>`_. If you have never used PyGMO before, please
consider reading our introductory guide: :ref:`Optimization with PyGMO`.
