Tudat Space
======================================


Tudat Space is a platform and community for astrodynamics and space research.
Our mission is to provide educators, researchers, students, and
enthusiasts access to a powerful toolkit, fuelling careers and
passions in astrodynamics and space. It contains user guides and tutorials to use Tudat and it is organized as follows:

- *Getting Started:* all the information for new users, including how to install tudatpy and some examples
  showcasing its functionalities.
- *User Guide:* several guides explaining how different parts of tudatpy code are used together to create a simulation.
- *Advanced topics*: guides for more advanced topics (e.g., optimization with Tudat).
- *Resources from Tudat ecosystem:* links to other Tudat resources (API reference, developer documentation, etc...)
  not hosted directly on tudat-space.
- *About:* additional information about Tudat and its ecosystem.

.. attention::

  As of Tudatpy version 0.7, a number of modifications have been made to how Tudatpy deals with vehicle orientations,
  in particular in the context of thrust and aerodynamic guidance. These changes are, in part, not backwards compatible.
  See :ref:`this page <backwards_incompatibility>` for more details. To continue to use the last older version of Tudat, install
  version 0.6.3.

What is Tudat?
===========================================

The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a powerful set of libraries that support astrodynamics and space research.
Such framework can be used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the study of reentry dynamic to interplanetary
missions. The functionality of Tudat is implemented in C++, but a Python interface, called Tudatpy, is now available,
through which the core simulation functionality can be accessed. Tudat and Tudatpy are disseminated as conda packages;
to get started with them, have a look at our
:ref:`installation guide<getting_started_installation>`.
