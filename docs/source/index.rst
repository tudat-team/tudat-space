        Learn how to use and install the open-source TU Delft Astrodynamics toolbox (Tudat), a powerful set of libraries that support astrodynamics and space research and education.

======================================
Welcome to Tudat Space!
======================================

The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a powerful set of libraries that support astrodynamics and space research.
Such framework can be used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the study of reentry dynamic to interplanetary
missions. The core functionality of Tudat is implemented in C++ and exposed to Python using an interface called Tudat(Py).
Tudat and Tudat(Py) are entirely open-source and disseminated using conda packages.
